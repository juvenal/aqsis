/**
  The main image and related data, also responsible for processing the rendering loop.
 
  Before the image can be rendered the image buffer has to be initialised by calling the
  SetImage() method. The parameters for the creation of the buffer are read from the
  current options (this includes things like the image resolution, bucket size,
  number of pixel samples, etc.).
  
  After the buffer is initialized the surfaces (gprims) that are to be rendered 
  can be added to the buffer. This is done by calling PostSurface() for each gprim.
  (note: before calling this method the gprim has to be transformed into camera space!)
  All the gprims that can be culled at this point (i.e. CullSurface() returns true) 
  won't be stored inside the buffer. If a gprim can't be culled it is assigned to
  the first bucket that touches its bound.
 
  Once all the gprims are posted to the buffer the image can be rendered by calling
  RenderImage(). Now all buckets will be processed one after another.
