/** \brief A class encapsulating Elliptically Weighted Average (EWA) filter
 * weight computation.
 *
 * EWA filtering is based on the convolution of several gaussian filters and
 * composition with the linear approximation to the image warp at the sampling
 * point.  The original theory was developed by Paul Heckbert et al. and is
 * well-explained in his masters thesis, "Fundamentals of Texture Mapping and
 * Image Warping", which may be found at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/.
 * "Physically Based Rendering" also has a small section mentioning EWA.
 *
 * The derivation of an EWA filter may be broken into four conceptual stages:
 *   1) Reconstruct a continuous image from the discrete samples using a
 *      gaussian *reconstruction filter*.  The reconstruction filter support
 *      should be wide enough to avoid samples "falling between" the discrete
 *      points of the source image.
 *   2) Apply a texture blur filter to this continuous image.
 *   3) Warp the 2D image into another part of the 2D plane with an
 *      arbitrary transformation.  This effect of the transformation on the
 *      filter kernel is approximated by the local linear approximation (ie,
 *      the Jacobian).
 *   4) Filter the resulting image with a gaussian "prefilter" before
 *      converting back to discrete samples.  The support of the prefilter
 *      should be wide enough to remove aliasing.
 *
 * The neat thing about EWA is that the full filter which you get after putting
 * the steps 1-4 together is just another gaussian filter acting on the
 * original image.  This means we can implement it by simple iteration over a
 * box in the source image which contains the filter support.  The result may
 * be computed deterministically and hence suffers from no sampling error.  The
 * inclusion of the linear transformation implies good anisotropic filtering
 * characteristics.
 *
 * A 2D gaussian filter may be defined by a quadratic form,
 *
 * \verbatim
 *   Q(x,y) = a*x^2 + (b+c)*x*y + d*y^2,
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * such that the filter weights are given by
 *
 * \verbatim
 *   W(x,y) = exp(-Q(x,y)).
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * This filter has infinite support; in practise we need to truncate it at some
 * point, ideally such that we leave only a fixed fraction of the filter
 * weight outside the truncated region.  To do this, we choose a cutoff
 * parameter, C for the weight function, and set all weights less than that
 * cutoff to zero.  The newly truncated filter weight, W', looks like:
 *
 * \verbatim
 *   W'(x,y) = W(x,y)     for W(x,y) >= C
 *           = 0          for W(x,y) < C
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * A curious and convenient feature of such gaussian filters in two dimensions
 * (and only in two dimensions!) is that the fraction of the *total* weight
 * which we're ignoring by doing this is just (1-C).  (To see this is true, do
 * the gaussian integrals inside and outside the cutoff. ;-) )  In practise we
 * work with the quantity logEdgeWeight = -ln(C) below.
