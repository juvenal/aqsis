|Aqsis| is a high quality, open source, renderer that adheres to the |RenderMan| standard. |Aqsis| provides a suite of tools that together enable the generation of production quality images from 3D scene data. Based on the *Reyes* rendering architecture, |Aqsis| focuses on providing the flexibility and control required for production rendering in the animation and film industries. 

|Aqsis| was released in 2000 under a GPL license, and has since been updated to include a combination of GPL and LGPL licensed components, allowing the inclusion of certain functionality into commercial and non-commercial applications, see the :ref:`legal` section for more information. Since its release, |Aqsis| has been continually developed and improved by a core team of developers, and includes contributions from developers in many fields.
