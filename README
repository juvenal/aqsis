Aqsis Renderer README
---------------------

Aqsis is a high quality, photorealistic, 3D rendering solution. It complies
with the RenderMan(R) interface standard defined by Pixar.

The RenderMan(R) standard has been used in film and television visual effects
since it's introduction in 1989. Pixar has used their own implementation for
all of their award winning CG features, and provided their implementation for
use in the visual effects of most major blockbuster films over the last 2
decades. The Aqsis project offers a way for individuals and organistaions alike
to gain experience with the RenderMan(R) interface without the cost of
commercial software licenses.

Aqsis comprises a command line rendering tool, a tool for compiling shaders in
the RSL language, a tool for preparing textures for optimal use, and various
developer libraries to enable integration with third party tools.
