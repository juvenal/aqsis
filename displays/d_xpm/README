*** XPM display driver for renderman compliant renderers. ***

This driver was built specially for integrating thumbnails in liquidmaya but it works like any other display driver.
Current implementation is supposed to work with aqsis, pixie and 3delight.
The driver should work ok with both AIR and RenderDotC but you must build it manually.


INSTALLATION

 The driver currently works with 3delight, pixie and aqsis renderers. here are the instructions for rendering with each one:
 
  AQSIS:
  
    - you must set $XPMRENDERER as 'aqsis' or 'Aqsis'.
    - you must set $AQSIS_BASE_PATH to point to your aqsis installation.
    - you must set $AQSIS_SRC to point to the libddmanager dir in the aqsis source dir.
    - run 'make'.
    - run 'make install' as root or with root privileges.
    
    This will create the file xpm.so in the $AQSIS_BASE_PATH/lib/aqsis directory and add a xpm entry to displays.ini pointing to xpm.so.

  3DELIGHT:
  
    - you must set $XPMRENDERER as '3delight' or '3Delight'.
    - you must set $DELIGHT to point to your 3delight installation.
    - run 'make'.
    - run 'make install' as root or with root privileges.
    
    This will create the file xpm.dpy in the $DELIGHT/displays directory.
 
  PIXIE:
  
    - you must set $XPMRENDERER as 'pixie' or 'Pixie'.
    - you must set $PIXIEHOME to point to your pixie installation.
    - run 'make'.
    - run 'make install' as root or with root privileges.
    
    This will create the file xpm.so in the $PIXIEHOME/lib directory.


FEATURES

 - Works in both RGB and RGBA modes.
 - works with several renderman-compliant renderers. Fully working at least with 3Delight, Pixie and Aqsis.
 - it uses a slight optimization according to the number of colors in the image


LIMITATIONS AND KNOWN BUGS

 - The rendering is limited to 3072x3072 resolution. This might change in the near future.
 - The driver might not render correctly if you provide a filename with '.' characters but without extension.


TODO LIST

 - Improve the coding style, like replacing malloc/realloc/free with C++ memory implementations, probably using std::vector class
 - Implement AIR install ( It should already work like it is )
 - Implement RenderDotC install ( It should work already )

MJO> I put a small test to know if your driver is installed correctly with 
aqsis called testxpm.bat
