# This file lists all available render jobs.
#
# A render job has the following form:
#
# RenderJob(workingdir="", rib="", shaders=[], outimagename=None, 
#           ricalls=[AUTO], description="", known_issues=None)
#
# workingdir:   Before rendering the current directory is set to this path.
#               This path has to be specified relative to the location of 
#               the config file.
# rib:          The name of the RIB file to render (relative to workingdir).
#               If the name doesn't end in ".rib" then the name is assumed
#               to be a program that outputs a RIB stream to stdout.
# shaders:      A list of shaders (relative to workingdir) that have to be
#               compiled before rendering.
# outimagename: The name of the final output image generated by the RIB
#               or a list of names if the RIB outputs more than one file
#               which should also be tested against reference images.
#               If no name is given, then the name of the RIB/script is used
#               and the suffix is replaced by ".tif".
# ricalls:      A list of strings explicitly specifying the Ri calls that
#               are tested by this job. If the list contains the keyword
#               AUTO the Ri calls list is created by scanning the RIB stream.
#               Additional calls may still be given. Any call that's 
#               explicitly listed will cause the test to appear in bold face 
#               under the corresponding call.
#               If this parameter is not set it defaults to [AUTO].
# description:  A string that describes the purpose of the RIB file.
#               This description is copied verbatim to the output HTML
#               pages, so you may add HTML markup.
# known_issues: A string that describes known issues with the test. This
#               means the reference image still is not perfectly all right,
#               but the problem is not relevant to the actual test.
#
# This file is executed as Python code so you can actually use any 
# valid Python construct. "RenderJob" is the name of a class, so you
# can also assign the result to a variable for later use (e.g. in your
# tasks config file).
