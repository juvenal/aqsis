/** \brief An interface for sampling texture buffers.
 *
 * Sampling consists of filtering the texture over some appropriate filter
 * region; filtering can be performed with either of the two sample()
 * functions.  These provide alternative interfaces to specify the filter
 * region.
 *
 * Classes which implement the interface may attempt to use the sampling method
 * as specified by a CqTexutureSampleOptions, passed to the sample() interface
 * function.  Since this class is designed to be part of the renderman shading
 * language texture sampling pipeline, the sample method should default to
 * something else quietly if it's not supported.
