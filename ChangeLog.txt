	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/texturemap.cpp,
	  trunk/aqsis/shadercompiler/shaderexecenv/shadeops_tmap.cpp: Fix
	  a bug in the "textureinfo" shadeop. The way it works is to query
	  the texture machinery for a named texture, which can return a
	  texture from the cache. If the texture is not of the right type,
	  it deletes it and moves onto the next. This deletion removes the
	  texture from the cache, so each time the texture is used, it had
	  to be reloaded. Combine with the fact that the texture deletion
	  code didn't close the file, resulted in the system exhausting
	  all available file handles.
	  
	  The deletion is removed, the cache handler will deal with
	  deleting loaded textures. And the top level texture destructor
	  now closes the file.

	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/texturemap.cpp,
	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/texturemap.h: Fix bug #1638918.
	  
	  The mipmapping code was storing the resulting texturemap buffers
	  in the m_apFlats section, when they should have been stored in
	  the m_apMipMaps section of the caching data. The result is that
	  when a "non-converted" texture was flushed from the cache, the
	  m_apFlats list was cleared (clearing all the mipmaps) but only
	  the first m_apLast entry was cleared. So when a new request for
	  data from that texture came along, the m_apLast entry for the
	  requested MipMap level pointed to a deleted buffer.

	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/imagers.cpp,
	  trunk/aqsis/shadercompiler/shadervm/shadervm.cpp: Fix a couple
	  of outstanding regressions introduced by the library refactor.
	  The imager shaders were being constructed with a CqShaderExecEnv
	  with NULL render context, resulting in a crash.
	  The initialisation execution function on the shaderVM was being
	  run against a similar CqShaderExecEnv with NULL render context,
	  resulting in failed transform() functions. The effect was
	  visible as differences in lighting, as "from" on the standard
	  shaders is initialised to (0,0,0) in "shader" space, so has a
	  transform in the initialisation code.

	* trunk/aqsis/shadercompiler/shadervm/shadervm.h: Fix a problem
	  introduced with the library refactor, specifically the code to
	  separate the shaderVM from the renderer core. The code to define
	  whether a shader was instantiated inside or outside the
	  RiWorldBegin call was commented out during refactoring, and not
	  reintroduced. The result being that the status of that flag was
	  random, based on the contents of memory, resulting in some
	  strange behaviour with lighting, for instance, the rendered
	  image looking different depending on the command line arguments
	  given.

	  only really available after install. However, the solution
	  doesn't work in all cases, firstly, it only works if RPATH is
	  being used, and then only if an alternative destdir isn't
	  specified. As the RPM build precludes the use or rpath, and
	  needs destdir, and only does a 'build', this couldn't work.
	  
	  Now the aqsistypes build dir is added to the PATH/RPATH in the
	  system specific SConscripts, which isn't ideal but should ensure
	  that the build completes.

	* trunk/aqsis/platform/default/SConscript: Fix bug #1632725.
	  Before the library refactor the executables needed to be linked
	  against
	  libdl, as it's functionality is required by the CqPlugin class
	  (libaqsistypes). However,
	  now, libaqsistypes is a shared library, so IT needs to be linked
	  against libdl, and not
	  the executables. Not sure why including fltk support masked the
	  problem, but it seems to
	  work now.

	  when
	  using.
	  libshadervm.so - new combined shader vm shared library,
	  including the
	  old libshaderexecenv.a, used by libslxargs.so, and libaqsis.so.
	  
	  Previous other static libraries are removed, and the object
	  files are
	  directly linked into the shared libraries/applications that need
	  them,
	  thus avoiding the mixing of static and shared compilation that
	  is a
	  problem for gcc.

	  trunk/aqsis/testing/regression/RIBs/Bugs/Bug1629458/jobs.cfg,
	  trunk/aqsis/testing/regression/RIBs/Bugs/Bug1629458/vnoise.sl:
	  Add regression test for Bug 1629458.

2007-01-07 03:52  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/shadercompiler/slparse/funcdef.cpp: Fix bug
	  [ 1629458 ] vector noise(...) functions missing from shading
	  language
	  
	  Create a set of noise functions with Type_Vector as the output
	  type, which are
	  otherwise identicle to the "point" versions of the noise
	  functions (including
	  sharing shadervm opcodes - is this a good idea?)

2007-01-07 02:41  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/shadercompiler/shadervm/shadervm.cpp: Correct
	  non-existance of the opcode ppnoise2. SO_ppnoise2 was
	  incorrectly
	  mapped to pnoise2.

2007-01-03 13:34  mbaas

	* trunk/aqsis/testing/regression/rendertester.py: Made the name of
	  the pdiff command customizable (the default name is still
	  'pdiff' instead of 'perceptualdiff').

2007-01-02 07:27  pgregory

	* trunk/aqsis/shadercompiler/shaderexecenv/shadeops_illum.cpp: Fix
	  the 'solar' SL construct so that the 'L' variable is more
	  appropriate in the case of a solar() call with no arguments.
	  
	  When used with no direction, solar is meant to represent a light
	  coming
	  from all directions at infinity. The new implementation uses the
	  inverse
	  of the surface normal, 'Ns' to represent a "good" incoming light
	  direction. Should be better for illumination map usage, as
	  intended by
	  the spec.

2006-12-13 15:37  joron

	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/texturemap.cpp: make sure we use
	  fastlog2() instead of the double arithmetic. So we will have
	  the same arithmetic as ri.cpp when we created the mipmap.

	  trunk/aqsis/shadercompiler/slparse/parsenode.h: Fix the
	  type-punned warnings issued by gcc4.1.x+ to do with strict
	  aliasing.
	  
	  Gcc 4.1 didn't like the way the interface querying worked, by
	  passing a pointer to a pointer to a
	  IqParseNode??? into the GetInterface function via a (void**)
	  cast, we were breaking the strict aliasing
	  rules of C++. However, it's ok to cast a void* to another
	  pointer type, so now we directly return the
	  interface pointer from GetInterface, and 0 if not a valid
	  interface cast.

2006-12-11 20:40  joron

	* trunk/aqsis/displays/display/display.cpp: fix for Bug1605954;
	  significant detail is around the line 685 where we did:
	  for (x = xmin; x < xmaxplus1; x++)
	  I should have done instead
	  for (x = xmin__; x < xmaxplus1__; x++)
	  I took the opportunity to translate few unsigned char to

2006-12-06 12:41  joron

	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/texturemap.cpp: remove one warning

	  I redo the implementation with a different solution.

2006-12-06 08:58  pgregory

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Fix a problem on Windows/MacOSX with

	  the build directory. (Don't need them
	  in cvsignore anymore)

2006-11-26 14:16  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Let scons work out the dependencies for
	  the dist* targets automatically.
	  The dist* targets should _not_ depend on aqsis being built (or
	  installed!)
	  already.

2006-11-26 14:04  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/thirdparty/dbo_plane/SConscript: Make sure

2006-11-19 00:10  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Changed with_pdiff to default to "no" -
	  Normal users won't have a need for the
	  regression tests.

2006-11-16 16:18  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Try to resolve clash between persistence
	  of options in options.cache, and
	  persistence in custom.py. Solution: if custom.py exists, use
	  that, otherwise
	  use options.cache for the defaults.

2006-11-16 15:25  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Added an option for a cache directory.
	  This speeds up builds where implicit
	  dependencies (like the SConstruct script) change frequently
	  between builds.
	  Ultimately: less frustration when modifing the build system.

2006-11-16 15:13  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct, trunk/aqsis/thirdparty/pdiff/SConscript:
	  Make a boolean option to install pdiff (default is "yes"). This
	  is cleaner
	  than trying to have the build system detect some prior
	  installation of pdiff.

2006-11-16 15:02  cgtobix

2006-11-13 23:50  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/platform/default/SConscript, trunk/aqsis/SConstruct:
	  Remove all $DESTDIR stuff to the *nix platform-specific

	* trunk/aqsis/platform/default/Options.py,
	  trunk/aqsis/platform/default/SConscript, trunk/aqsis/SConstruct:
	  Add a $DESTDIR construction variable to aid linux packagers.
	  
	  If $DESTDIR is nonempty, all files which normally go into
	  '$path' are installed
	  to '$DESTDIR/$path'. This is achieved by replacing the scons
	  Install() function
	  with a wrapper which modifies the requested install path.

	* trunk/aqsis/distribution/win/nsis/setup.nsi: Windows (NSIS)
	  installer now uses absolute paths, rather than relative paths,
	  to find the relevant project files to include.

2006-11-13 10:17  pgregory

	* trunk/aqsis/distribution/win/nsis/SConscript: Pass a new

	  the project root.

2006-11-13 07:29  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Add an install and build alias. Unix
	  users can now have the usual two-stage
	  build and install.

2006-11-13 05:56  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Revert recent change to distribution
	  build path.
	  
	  I've realised this plays badly with the $build_prefix option and
	  may break some
	  scripts. There's another way to achieve the same thing, but it
	  adds rather
	  more complexity.

2006-11-13 05:38  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Make the distribution builders (eg NSIS)
	  run in a seperate directory,
	  'build_dist'. This seems to be the least messy way which we can
	  achieve having
	  the build directory as an alias for building aqsis rather than
	  installing it.
	  Otherwise, running "scons build" will try to run NSIS as well.

2006-11-13 05:26  c42f

	* trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Make LIBPATH refer to the build
	  directories for libraries rather than the
	  install directories. Needed for seperate build and install
	  targets.

2006-11-12 11:37  ltatkinson

	* trunk/aqsis/distribution/win/nsis/setup.nsi: Windows (NSIS)
	  installer now 'Fully' removes related registry entries upon
	  uninstall - For example, correct updating of the %PATH% variable
	  once Aqsis is uninstalled.

	* trunk/aqsis/displays/d_exr/SConscript,

	  trunk/aqsis/SConstruct: Clean up the way that SConscript files
	  in subdirectories are called. Now
	  avoids the cut-and-paste needed to add new sub-SConscript files.
	  
	  Clean up the way that the build directory is specified (use
	  BuildDir() rather
	  than build_dir in each separate SConscript() call.)
	  
	  Make sure that _every_ file which is built (including aqsisrc,
	  version.h and
	  all of the plugins) is built inside the build directory.
	  
	  Fix bug where d_sdcWin32 plugin wouldn't get distributed (ie put
	  into
	  $ZIPDISTDIR) if run on a non-win32 system.
	  
	  Change the way exr info is returned to SConstruct (use Return()
	  rather than
	  Export())

	* trunk/aqsis/platform/default/Options.py,

	  trunk/aqsis/rib/rib2/librib.cpp: Fix a problem with the RI API
	  debgging output. Before, the output strings were being
	  constructed irrespective of the logging level, as the logging
	  filtering works by passing the strings anyway, and letting the
	  log decide whether to display it or not. This was inefficient,
	  especially for very large RI calls, such as PointsPolygons
	  (moreso on VC6 than anywhere else due to a 'mis-feature' in
	  their STL).
	  
	  Now API output is separate from the log verbosity level. Instead
	  of being part of the DEBUG log level, it is entirely separate.
	  To get API output, pass the -echoapi command line switch. A side
	  effect is that the -v3 level is now just for debug messages, so
	  if you want debug output, you don't get flooded with API calls.
	  
	  During this change I noticed that the default "current" log
	  level if no stream modifier is used, is undefined. I've fixed
	  that now, so it defaults to 0, i.e. pass everything. So now if
	  you do Aqsis::log() << "message"... it will print irrespective
	  of chosen verbosity level, as no log level has been defined.
	  
	  Also had to add some sanity checks to the debug output to check
	  if a valid render context and options are available before
	  trying to query the "statistics" "echoapi" option.

	  When enabled, passing '-mpdump' to aqsis will cause a file
	  'mpdump.mp' to be generated containing a dump of micropolygons
	  and other data generated by Aqsis during rendering. This file
	  can be processed using the mpanalyse.py tool.
	  
	  The '-mpdump' command line option basically sets the option
	  
	  Option "mpdump" "integer enabled" [1]
	  
	  so setting this Option in the RIB will have the same effect, 1
	  is enabled, 0 is disabled.

	  environment, such as PATH are to be done in the platform

	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/ri.cpp: Revert change 336. The fix
	  for bug #1326794 introduced a regression on bug #906365. The fix
	  for #1326794 is not to clamp the opacity, further investigation
	  is needed.
	  
	  Comparing the output of Aqsis with other renderers shows that
	  the light pink colour that the centre sphere is mostly coloured
	  is the right colour, we need to determine what is causing the
	  artefacts, I suspect it's something to do with occlusion or
	  colour combining.

	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/ri.cpp: Fix the regression for

	  the RiCurves
	  call, which was fine before, but now we have the two stage scene
	  setup due to multipass rendering it
	  is no longer a suitable solution. The reason being that the
	  width doesn't get properly transformed
	  when posting to the world.

	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/ri.cpp: Accidentally broke the
	  non-multipass mode when fixing the multipass
	  (autoshadows) mode. It is important when rendering non-multipass
	  that
	  the image is 'setup' as the primitives are all fasttracked into
	  the
	  pipe, and this process needs the bucket information. In
	  multipass mode,
	  this information isn't needed until the RenderWorld call when
	  the cached
	  primitives are entered into the pipeline.

	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/renderer.h,
	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/ri.cpp: Fix the rendering of
	  autoshadows.
	  
	  There was a problem with the order in which the options were
	  stored
	  and restored, and when the camera transformation was applied.
	  
	  Now the camera transformation is done outside the RenderWorld
	  call
	  as part of the function that is requesting the render. This
	  ensures
	  that the options are pushed before changing the transformation,
	  and
	  popped before restoring it. The reason for this is that the code
	  that
	  sets up the camera needs access to the ScreenWindow etc. options.

	* trunk/aqsis/testing/regression/renderers.cfg,
	  trunk/aqsis/testing/regression/rendertester.py: Changed the way
	  renderer and shader compiler commands are specified in
	  the Renderer class. Instead of a single string, which may
	  contain
	  arguments, they are now a string list, first string is the
	  command,
	  subsequent strings the optional arguments. This is because the
	  previous
	  method breaks on Unix systems when the shell=True argument is
	  passed to
	  subprocess.Popen.
	  
	  With the old system, the command line worked out to be...
	  
	  /bin/sh -c ""aqsis --nocolor" test.rib"
	  
	  which failed because "aqsis --nocolor" doesn't exist.
	  
	  Also, modified the way the command is passed to Popen, as on
	  Unix
	  systems, if the 'args' property is a list, the first value is
	  the
	  command line (in it's entirety), and subsequent values are
	  arguments to
	  the shell, not to Aqsis. i.e.
	  
	  subprocess.Popen(["aqsis", "test.rib"]...)
	  
	  results in
	  
	  /bin/sh -c aqsis test.rib
	  
	  where test.rib goes to the shell not Aqsis, and thus Aqsis sits
	  there
	  waiting for stdin input. The way to fix this is to use
	  subprocess.list2cmdline to combine the array of args into one
	  before
	  calling Popen.

	  were no longer visible. Now, all variable checks scan up the
	  scope stack until they hit a terminal scope, i.e. one introduced
	  by a function definition.
	  
	  This is only a temporary fix, the correct solution is to
	  introduce a proper nested symbol table, which is a much bigger
	  job.

	  In a normal grid, there are nxm polys and (n+1)x(m+1) shading

	  to allow for interpolation across the grid, for points, there are
	  nxm polys and shading points. Now the construction code, which

	  grid
	  can report a different value.
	  
	  Fix the handling of varying values on points primitives, the
	  values are
	  copied directly to the shadervariable, without dicing, whereas
	  normally

	  Camera transformation is stored in a standard CqTransform, along

	  transformation is cleared and the camera transformation stored.
	  When calculating bounding boxes for primitives, the
	  AdjustBoundForTransformationMotion function on the base class
	  now also takes into account any movement imparted by a moving
	  camera. Similarly, when projecting the micropolygons during the
	  Split() function, camera transformation motion is acounted for
	  at the same time as object transformation motion.
	  
	  This makes more sense, and is essential for the support of
	  automatic rendering passes. Before, the 'main' camera motion was
	  applied to the objects, which meant during rendering of auto
	  passes, like autoshadows, the objects would be moving accordind
	  to the camera motion which doesn't make sense for a shadow pass.

	  division services for the shading language, and to reformat the
	  matrix output from the SL printf function to be more usable.
	  
	  ------------------------
	  
	  Here's another patch. This one provides matrix multiplication
	  and
	  division services for the shading language.
	  
	  I've tested it by:
	  1) running the regression tests against an untouched copy of the
	  latest
	  svn - they both produce the same output
	  2) writing a shader to spit out the results of M1*M2 and M1/M2
	  via
	  printf, and compare to an external program (cgkit & matlab)
	  
	  The file is matrix_shadeops.patch
	  
	  I'm attaching another patch as well
	  (printf_matrix_format.patch). This
	  one changes the formatting which the printf function gives to
	  matrices
	  in the shader language. In particular, it prints matrices on a
	  single
	  line which is IMHO much easier to work with, particulary since
	  the
	  output can be filtered by unix utilities such as sort and uniq.
	  3delight also uses a single line format.

	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/ri.cpp: oups; after a merge I forgot
	  to include blobby.h

2006-04-01 12:33  joron

	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/ri.cpp,
	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/SConscript: add support for
	  blobbies. this is a first version
	  which I don't want to loose. I will continue to work on
	  some issues/caveats I already found.

	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/blobby.h,
	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/jules_bloomenthal.cpp,
	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/jules_bloomenthal.h: this is the
	  code from Romain which was a bit modified by me to be like aqsis
	  style guideline.
	  
	  it is the implementation for blobby and its polygonizer; right
	  now some caveats are there. divide, subtract doesn't work,
	  segments are not working either.
	  remain to implement repression plane and constant blobby.
	  some work need to be done with the polygonizer itself in
	  particular anything around the bounding box,
	  yet another polygonizer could be good too and the equation
	  (implicit_functor) could be exact and give as DSO later.

	* trunk/aqsis/platform/win32/SConscript,
	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/ri.cpp,
	  trunk/aqsis/rib/miqser/SConscript: Fix a couple of small
	  compilagtion problems with the Win32 MingW build.

2006-03-30 21:37  pgregory

	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/aqsis/aqsis.cpp: Simple change to aqsis
	  help, mainly to check buildbot notification

	* trunk/aqsis/shadercompiler/shadervm/dsoshadeops.cpp,
	  trunk/aqsis/testing/systemtests/dsotest/dsotest.rib: Add some
	  more useful information output to the DSO shadeop search to
	  enable better debugging
	  of the DSO loading process.
	  Updated the DSO test to setup the DSO path properly so that it
	  works.

2006-03-25 18:24  mbaas

	* trunk/aqsis/testing/regression/rendertester.py: Use the
	  os.path.join() function to create the command to execute a file.
	  This ensures that the correct path separator is used (the
	  forward slash wasn't working on Windows).

2006-03-24 13:56  pgregory

	* trunk/aqsis/rib/rib2/parser.yy, trunk/aqsis/rib/rib2/scanner.ll:

	  request on the error stream.

2006-03-24 13:56  pgregory

	* trunk/aqsis/rib/rib2/bdec.cpp: Fix an error in the binary

	  cutoff is 127.

	  the binary parser.

2006-03-24 12:00  pgregory

	* trunk/aqsis/rib/miqser/miqser.cpp: Add an argument to miqser so
	  that it can optionally output the StandardDeclarations to the
	  resulting RIB, just in case the RIB is destined for a renderer
	  that doesn't produce the same default declarations as aqsis.

	  trunk/aqsis/rib/rib2/parser.yy: Update the implementation of
	  StandardDeclarations so that it is possible to pass in a NULL
	  RendermanInterface. If that is so, the declarations are
	  registered with the parser, but not with the 'renderer'. This
	  allows miqser to parse safely, without outputting the default
	  declarations to every file it processes.

2006-03-23 22:27  pgregory

	* trunk/aqsis/rib/ri2rib/binary.cpp: Fix a problem in the output
	  of binary RIB data.
	  The output of encoded requests was not outputting the
	  request code properly, because it was being processed as an
	  int, instead of a char, so all requests were getting the code
	  '\00'.

2006-03-23 00:03  pgregory

2006-03-23 00:01  pgregory

	* trunk/aqsis/rib/rib2/parser.yy: Fix the handling of lightsource
	  handles, 0 is not an invalid handle, a handle can be anything.
	  The ri2rib library returns incrementing integers as handles, so
	  0 is valid.

	* trunk/aqsis/rib/miqser, trunk/aqsis/rib/miqser/miqser.cpp,

	  trunk/aqsis/testing/regression/RIBs/Misc/detail.rib: Fix the
	  handling of LevelOfDetail, broken since the introduction of
	  auto* rendering.
	  May be a little slower processing primitives now, as the bound
	  needs to be transformed into raster space for each surface, but
	  under normal operation it should be negligible.
	  This actually showed that our LOD has not ever worked properly,
	  and in fact the regression suite test was showing the wrong
	  result.

	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/points.h: Remove extra class
	  specifications, gcc4.1 complains about them.
	  Added empty operator% to CqColor, used by the shaderVM macros,
	  gcc4.1 needs
	  a real implementation.

	  trunk/aqsis/shadercompiler/shadervm/shadervm.h: Fix the lighting
	  problem with lightsources defined outside the WorldBegin/End
	  block.
	  The problem is that at definition time, the shader's idea of
	  'camera' space is identity, while
	  at 'preparation' time, it is different, it is the real camera
	  space either that defined as the
	  camera in the RIB (i.e. at the time of RiWorldBegin) or that
	  defined during a custom render
	  pass, like autoshadows.
	  
	  As this can only possibly affect lightsources, because it is
	  illegal to define other shader types
	  outside the world block, we now check if the lightsource is
	  being defined outside the world block
	  at definition time, and if so, just go ahead and initialise the
	  parameters now, as they are
	  invariant under any camera space changes applied during and
	  auto* pass. In addition we store
	  with a shader whether it was defined outside the world block,
	  and if so, ignore the request
	  to 'prepare' the shader, as it is already properly prepared.

	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/polygon.h: Fix bug #141074. The
	  transformation of RiPointsPolygons was broken due to the work
	  underway to support autoshadows.
	  
	  The polygon points class had a check to ensure that it was only
	  transformed once. This was because the individual polygons used
	  to pass their Transform() calls through to the points, and if a
	  transform was applied to a more than one of the member polygons,
	  the points would have been transform twice, incorrectly.
	  
	  Now, the points can be transformed as many times as required,
	  but the Transform() call on the individual polygons causes an
	  error and does nothing. This is safe because the individual
	  polygons don't enter the pipeline until the first split, at
	  which point the rendering has begun, so transforming the
	  surfaces is invalid anyway.

	* trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/shadowmap.cpp,
	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/texturemap.cpp,
	  trunk/aqsis/renderer/render/texturemap.h: occlusion() is a lot
	  more faster. You will see gain of performance something
	  like from 30 hours down to 4 or 5 minutes when you use occlusion
	  maps.
	  
	  Essentially I reduce the number of sampling for occlusion map
	  based on the fact a occlusion map has a lot of maps.
	  
	  Is this shadowmap an occlusion map (NumPages() > 1) ?
	  NumPages() contains the number of shadowmaps which were used
	  to create this occlusion map.
	  if ns, nt is computed assuming only one shadow map; let try
	  divide
	  both numbers by the sqrt() of the number of maps.
	  
	  eg: assuming I have 256 shadowmaps (256x256) in one occlusion
	  map
	  and ns = nt = 16 (depends solely of the du,dv,blur)
	  Than the number of computations will be at the worst case
	  (re-visit each Z values on each shadowmaps).
	  256 shadows * ns * nt * 256 * 256. or the 4G operations.
	  
	  We need to reduce the number of operations by one or two order
	  of magnitude then.
	  An solution is to divide the numbers ns,nt by the sqrt(number
	  of shadows).
	  In the examples something in range of
	  256x256x256 x (16 x 16) / (8 x 8) or 256 x 256 x 256 x 2 x 2
	  or 6M
	  operations good start.
	  But what happens if you only have 4 shadows ?
	  256x256x256 x (16 x 16) /( 2 x 2) or 256x256x256x64 about 1G
	  it is worst than with 256 maps. So I chose another solution
	  is to do
	  following let recompute ns, nt so the number of operations
	  will
	  never reach more 256k.
	  1) Bigger the number of shadowmap smaller ns, nt will be
	  required;
	  2) Bigger the shadowmaps than smaller ns, nt;
	  
	  if (NumPages() > 1) {
	  TqInt occl = (256 * 1024) / (NumPages() * XRes() * YRes());
	  occl = CEIL(sqrt(occl));
	  occl = MAX(2, occl);
	  ns = nt = occl;
	  }
	  
	  I also add the necessary support for occlusion maps to benefit
	  from
	  the same enhancement as the regular shadowmap mainly the minz
	  value.
	  Also made a cache for each shadowmaps based on the number of
	  maps
	  instead of one per shadow it is not a std::map cache.

	  occlusion maps benefit from the same kind of optimization as the
	  shadowmap could have. Mainly each shadowmap composing an
	  occlusion map store its minimum value. Later when occlusion() is
	  called it looks first if the min. value was saved for a certain
	  shadowmap and discard quickly the sample which could have been
	  in shadow.
	  
	  make sure the display compute the min value as double value (to
	  save in the tiff file as SMinSample).
	  
	  make sure if you use either MakeShadow, MakeOcclusion or output
	  directly as "shadow" the minimum value for a shadow is saved
	  correctly into the shadow tiff file or occlusion tiff file.

	  I tried to eliminate the area computation for three
	  cases:
	  1) if a minimum value of z in a tiff shadowmap is greater than
	  Z of a point we know for sure the P is not in shadow.
	  2) if a minimum value of z in a tiff tile buffer is greater
	  than Z of a point
	  3) if a maximum value (not infinite) of tile buffer is lower
	  than Z of a point we know the P is in shadow.
	  
	  In order to have 1) I need to change slightly display.cpp
	  display.cpp will save the minimum Z value; later shadow()
	  could reject
	  any object which has z value lower than the minimum Z value of
	  the complete
	  tiff shadowmap.
	  
	  In order to do 2),3) I need to change shadowmap.cpp
	  shadowmap.cpp will visit each tile of shadowmap; it will
	  compute once the minz and maxz; if for a tile the minz/maxz will
	  be used to reduce computation required for the shadow.
	  
	  texturemap.h I add more method MinMax() for CqShadowMapBuffer.
