/*
 * The ArgParse class allows you to specify names of options
 * that you want parsed, along with a usage message for them.
 * Options come in four flavors: flag, int, float, and string.
 * Flags don't take arguments, but the other kinds do.  For
 * an option that takes an argument, it can be specified with
 * an equals sign, with a colon, or by putting it in the next
 * element of argv.  ("--foo=stuff", "--foo:stuff", or
 * "--foo stuff", respectively)
 *
 * The flavors that take arguments also come in array flavors.
 * With an array, you specify a pointer to a vector of the basic
 * type, instead of just a pointer to a basic type.  This allows
 * the option to appear more than once, and the new values are
 * appended to the array.  Optionally, you can also specify a
 * separator character, so that multiple array elements can be
 * parsed up from a single instance of the option.
 *
 * Options can start with either a single dash or a double dash,
 * but see allowOneCharOptionsToBeCombined() for more information.
 *
 * The argument "--" all by itself signals the end of the options,
 * and everything after it will go into the leftovers (see leftovers())
 * even if it starts with a dash.
 *
 * The usage text for an option gets appended immediately after the
 * name of the option and its aliases.  The ASCII BEL character (\a)
 * can be used as a special kind of tab, which moves the cursor to
 * the current indent level (see usageHeader()), to make it easy to
 * make things line up in columns.
 */

/*
 * Rationale for some design decisions:
 *
 * Things which need to be modified are passed as pointers, not as
 * references, because some people feel that non-const references make
 * what's going on less clear, and I kind of agree with them.
 *
 * Arrays are explicitly passed as std::vector (or whatever you change
 * the typedefs below to) instead of passing around iterators and
 * allowing any STL container to be used, just because unnecessary
 * templatization can be less clear and sometimes leads to portability
 * and debugability issues, and doesn't seem justified for this simple
 * application.

		// The most common use of this would be to add the
		// "Usage: blech [options] files" at the top, but it can also be
		// used to make different "sections" of options (give the --help
		// option to GNU tar to see what I mean) or to make a footer at the
		// end of the usage.  Your string can contain newlines, but it
		// shouldn't end in a newline unless you want an extra blank line.
		// The "indent" value specifies how to line up
		// columns of individual usage messages in the follow section.
		// (Again, refer to the GNU tar usage message to see what I mean.)
