/** \brief An tree for occlusion culling of bounded objects.
 *
 * Given the bound for an object, the task of CqOcclusionTree is to decide
 * whether the object is partially visible or completely hidden by previously
 * rendered objects.  (If the latter, the object can usually be thrown away
 * immediately.)
 *
 * The tree uses a binary space partition in alternate directions (x,y) and is
 * stored in an array for efficiency.  Each tree node stores the maximum depth
 * found in occluding samples connected to its child nodes.  This means that if
 * a surface is further away than the root node (for example) it can be safely
 * culled, and so on down the tree.
 *
 * The tree covers the samples in a bucket such that each leaf node corresponds
 * to exactly one sample position.  In general, the number of samples in a
 * bucket won't be a power of two.  In this case we allow the tree to "hang
 * off the edge" of the bucket to the bottom right.  For example, consider 3x3
 * samples in a bucket (small bucket!).  The next bigger occlusion tree that
 * can cover the samples is 4x4; the covering looks like this:
 * 
 * \verbatim
 * 
 *           bucket extent
 *           <------------>
 *         
 *          +====+====+====+----+
 *     ^   ||    |    |    ||   |
 *     |   ||    |    |    || 0 |
 *     |   |+----+----+----+----+
 *     |   ||    |    |    ||   |
 *     |   ||    |    |    || 0 |

 *          | 0  | 0  | 0  |  0 |
 *          +----+----+----+----+
 *
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * Leaf nodes marked with a 0 are unused, with depths set to zero so they don't
 * interfere with the tree updates.
