# This is a style file for the "Artistic Style" code formatting program, astyle.
#
# It encodes roughly how we'd like the code to look in aqsis, but isn't really
# a substitute for writing neat code by hand.
#
# See the files codestyle.{cpp,h} for a better introduction to the aqsis coding
# style.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# C/C++ indenting mode.
mode=c

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Always put block brackets on seperate lines.
brackets=break
# If two statements are on a line, leave them that way.
one-line=keep-statements

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Indenting
# Indent 'class' blocks so that the blocks 'public:', 'protected:' and 'private:' are indented.
indent-classes
# Indent with tabs equal to four spaces.
indent=tab=4
# Indent switch blocks. The astyle docs seem a bit confused about this (ie,
# indent-cases seems to do what indent-switches is advertised to do in the docs...)
indent-switches
#indent-cases

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Space-padding
# We could also insert padding of a single space around all operators:
#pad=oper
# And also pad the brackets:
#pad=paren

# Space is better chosen carefully for emphasis however.  Compare:
#
# x = 2*(a-f) + b*(c-d)/2;
#
# x = 2 * (a - f) + b * (c - d) / 2;
#
# x = 2 * ( a - f ) + b * ( c - d ) / 2;
#
# The first is rather clearer than the others.  Unfortunately, we've gotta
# forgo any astyle padding to get it to stay that way.
