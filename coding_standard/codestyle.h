// DOXYGEN

// Code should be documented with doxygen comments.  Documenting the contents
// of this file, we have:

/** \file
 *
 * \author Chris Foster (hopefully representing the teams' view)
 *
 * \brief An example file describing the aqsis coding style.
 *
 * Aqsis has a bunch of informal conventions; this file tries to gather
 * together the best parts of such conventions and give a relatively short and
 * easy-to-digest introduction to the way we'd like new code to look.
 *
 * We know a lot of our old code doesn't follow these rules, but we have to
 * start somewhere.
 */

// Doxygen comments should precede every function and type declaration.
//
// Note that I've been very verbose here for the sake of demonstration, but
// don't take this to mean "document for the sake of documenting".  Remember
// that documentation is only useful if it increases the clarity of the code.
//
// Aqsis includes many specialised algorithms which have been taken from
// various books and papers, (or just plain worked out).  If you use a
// particular source to understand an algorithm, reference it!

//------------------------------------------------------------
// INDENTING; astyle
//
// Rules for indenting, bracket placement etc. are encapsulated in a custom
// .astylerc file for the code formatting program "Artistic Style".  See also
// the comments in the astylerc file.
//
// The more important rules encapsulate:
//   * Indent using tab characters equivalent to 4 spaces
//   * Break block brackets to separate lines, i.e. ANSI C/C++ style
//   * Indent classes so that the keywords public, protected and private are indented
//   * Indent switches so that the case statements are indented
//   * Indent cases so that the code block is indented from the case statement
//
// While astyle tries to do a good job, it doesn't really match carefully
// hand-written code.  If you follow the guidelines above (and in particular
// the examples below), the code will be clearer than if it needed to go
// through astyle.
