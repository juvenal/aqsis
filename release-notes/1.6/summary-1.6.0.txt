Summary of changes in aqsis-1.6.0 


Enhancements
------------

Optimisations:
    * Avoid recomputing samples at overlapping bucket boundaries
    * CqMatrix Optimisations
    * Removal of IqBound
    * Substantially refactored sampling and occlusion culling code
          o Tight bounding boxes for sampling
          o Revive old rasterizer code rather than using a sampling tree
          o New cache-friendly occlusion tree
          o Occlusion culling prior to micropolygon sampling
          o Improved sampling speed for RiPoints
    * Enable the "focusfactor" approximation for depth of field by default
    * Implement the "motionfactor" approximation for motion blur
    * Improved shadow map rendering speed
    * Faster splitting code for large point clouds

Other changes:

    * Piqsl interface refactor
          o Single window interface
          o Improved keyboard shortcuts
          o Improved zooming
          o Z-buffer support
    * Texturing improvements
          o Rewritten environment filtering as part of aqsis_tex
          o Finer control over texture filtering with "minwidth" and "trunc" 
            parameters.
    * Smooth shading interpolation for depth of field and motion blur
    * Matte alpha support for directly rendering shadows on otherwise 
      transparent surfaces
    * New RIB parser
          o Better error reporting
    * Multilayer support for OpenEXR display
    * Side Effects Houdini plugin
