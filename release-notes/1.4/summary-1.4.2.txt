* Revised Windows installer, removing unnecessary features and improved logging.


Bugfixes
--------

* Fix incorrect fixed-size integer types in ndspy.h on some platforms.
* Fix bug #2128051: "8-bit character encoding missing"
* Fix printing of parameter lists which was missing the token names when using -echoapi
* Remove the AQSIS_USE_PLUGINS option from the build system to avoid confusion and broken builds.

* Correct the array length count as passed by the RIB parser into RiColorSamples.
* Fix texture(..., "lerp", 1) which incorrectly used mipmap level 1 when magnifying a texture

* Fix bug #2499967: ".aqsisrc no-longer supports backslashes in paths"


Known Issues
------------

  * Piqsl only updates the non-zoomed image at present, meaning you will need to zoom-out to the 1:1 size to see render progress. #2022177
  * Smooth shading interpolation does not presently support depth-of-field and motion blur features.
  * The "expandgrids" attribute does not presently support semi-opaque surfaces and shadows using either "depthfilter" or "midpoint".
  * Massive Software's "DynamicLoad" procedural plugin is presently not supported.
  * The "mpanalyse.py" Python script will not operate standalone and assumes both CGKit and PyOpenGL are installed on your system.
  * Backslash support within 'aqsisrc' paths has been removed, in accordance with the RISpec (reserved character).
