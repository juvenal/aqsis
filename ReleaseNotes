                         ------------------------
 
These are the Release notes for the Aqsis 1.4 branch.

INSTALL file for detailed instructions.


Features and Improvements
-------------------------

Aqsis-1.4 features include

  * Eqsl - A user interface for Aqsis.
  * Piqsl - An advanced, non-blocking, framebuffer.
  * AqsisTex - An improved texture handling system and library.
  * Smooth shading interpolation.
  * Internal shader pre-processor.
  * Linux desktop integration.
  * Many bugfixes


Caveats and Deprecations relative to 1.2
----------------------------------------

Shadow sampling: with the new aqsistex library, shadow sampling now uses
exactly the number of samples requested.  The old behaviour used a lot more
samples than requested in many circumstances, so values for the "samples"
parameter may need to be increased.
