  These are the Release notes for the Aqsis 1.2 branch.

    Instaallation
    -------------

  The build system now relies on SCons on all platforms. Please refer to the INSTALL file
for details instructions.

    Caveates and Depreacttions relative to 1.0
    -------------------------------------------

  DSO Search Behaviour - The DSO search behaviour has been changed to be more in-line with
other implementations. AQSIS_DSO_PATH, -dsolibs, and the related RiOption searchpaths have
been removed. DSOs are now searched for in the same directory as normal shaders.

  Shadow Sampling - Shadow sampling has been significantly improved, users should be aware 
that the results are significantly different from shadows produced by Aqsis 1.0 and other
stable releases.
