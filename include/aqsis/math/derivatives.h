/** \brief Compute first differences on a grid.
 *
 * This class performs the discrete analogue to differentiation on a regular grid.
 * The discrete first difference on a 1D grid is conceptually just the
 * difference between consecutive grid points:
 *
 *   diff(Y, i) = Y[i+1] - Y[i];
 *
 * This difference is most naturally identified geometrically with the line
 * segment between the grid points i+1 and i, but often we want to return a
 * difference which is relevant to the point i, the centred difference:
 *
 *   diff(Y, i) = (Y[i+1] - Y[i-1])/2;
 *
 * This class provides a choice between the two, depending on the values of
 * "useCentred" in the constructor.
 *
 * For 1D and 0D grids, differences may not be defined in one or both
 * directions; the variables uDiffZero and vDiffZero exist to turn off such
 * derivatives.
