/**
 * These are debug and non-debug versions of the macros ADDREF and RELEASEREF.
 *
 * ADDREF increments the reference count of a pointer to a CqRefCount-derived 
 * class, while RELEASEREF decrements the reference count, causing the object 
 * to be freed when the reference count is less than or equal to zero.
 * 
 * The non-debug versions simply call AddRef() and Release() methods on the
 * object (which is assumed to be a pointer to a CqRefCount-derived class).  
 * The debug versions include the file name and line where the macro was 
 * called, to enable this information to be tracked for debugging purposes.

/**
 * \class CqRefCount
 *
 * This class provides a reference counting form of memory management for
 * Aqsis.
 *
 * This class is implemented in two different ways.  One way is a debug
 * version, which keeps track of AddRef() and Release() calls so that bugs
 * can be tracked easily.  The second version is a much faster, minimal
 * implementation that is used for non-debug builds.
 * 
 * The basic idea with this class is that derived classes will have the
 * AddRef() function called whenever a new object needs access to the
 * derived class.  Calling AddRef() effectively marks the derived class as
 * "in use", and prevents it from being de-allocated.  When the object no 
 * longer needs the derived class, it will call Release().  Finally, when 
 * the last class has called Release(), the reference counter realises
 * that nobody needs it anymore and automatically deletes itself.
